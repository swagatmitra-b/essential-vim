## Essential Vim motions

> This is not a Vim tutorial, but a compilation of what I think are the most useful Vim motions. Almost all of the keybindings are default Vim keybinds. The ones that are not are stated explicitly. Some commands are ***VSCode Vim specific*** and may not work in Vim or Neovim. Please read [this article](https://swagatmitrab.netlify.app/blog/vim-like-no-one-else/) to understand the intuition behind these commands.
